//instead of usi'g psychometric thinking,

//it then means that high energy sytels.will completely delete all.of.the usb bits.
//tonprevent it, we can set three tresholds at each bits transfer.
//this allow us to keep track of 17 or 12 stack trace because we deal with physics.
//plus, plancks constant is preserved but would fail to choose an ai model in the sender messages.
//so we have to send the chose' tresholds to super computer that sent the packers.
//ghis means that the super compiter power supply must not force communication for 10^-15 MeV communications.


//the shared pointers would be pointers better than linux kernel pointers.
//and the number of max processes would be set to 10^15 which seems what linux kernel could accept.
//then, to have a better overview of non subsystem process stacks, we would use three tresholds
//the tresholds must not be a key concept to those models.
//so use som toolbox.
